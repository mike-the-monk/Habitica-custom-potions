# Habitica-customizations
I like customizing Habitica using its API, and my scripts automate and/or simplify the process for me.

**I no longer keep this repo up-to-date, I've moved everything in Custom Skills and Custom Potions into one repository that houses everything: https://github.com/mike-the-monk/Habitica-customizations**

For information about each of the customizations, see the appropriate wiki page, I keep those up-to-date. The wiki pages include a description of what the script does and installation instructions.

Here is a list of all of the customizations I've made, as well as a link to their wiki page:

***FCV â€“ these scripts automate things you can do using Fixed Character Values***

 - **Experience Potion and Mana Potion** - pay 25 GP for 150 XP or 30 MP. https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Experience_Potion_and_Mana_Potion
 - **Anti-Potions** - a crowd of onlookers will pay you 25 GP to drink a concoction that somewhat weakens you (-30 MP, -15 HP, or -150 XP). https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Anti-Potions
 - **Swap HP or XP for MP** - pay 5 HP or 50 XP to gain 10 MP. https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Swap_HP_or_XP_for_MP
 - **Editable Fix Character Values Buttons** - an expansion on my first three scripts, creating custom reward buttons whose text you can edit to change what the reward does. https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Editable_Fix_Character_Values_Buttons

***Game Modes***

 - **Low Constitution Mode** - for added challenge, press the button once to enter Low Constitution Mode (sets your CON to 1 with a negative buff that wears off at Cron) and thus you take more damage. Press it again to exit that mode. https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Low_Constitution_Mode
 - **Bad Day Mode** - some days, it's better to rest than to do all of your tasks. Pressing the button fully heals you, buffs your CON to 9999, and Stealths all your Dailies so you take no damage if you miss them. https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Bad_Day_Mode
- **Partial Healing** - normally, you fully heal upon leveling up. Players who want an added challenge can instead only partially heal upon level up. https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Partial_Healing
 - **Dueling Script** - Challenge another player to a duel and the script keeps track of your score. Whoever wins gets the GP that both of you wagered. https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Dueling_Script

***Custom skills***

 - **Cross-Class Stat Buffs** - use stat buff skills from other classes to buff yourself (but not your Party). https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Cross-Class_Stat_Buffs
 - **Cross-Class Skills** - use skills from other classes at a slightly higher mana cost. Also adds two new boss damage skills, one based on PER and one based on CON. https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Cross-Class_Skills
    
***Just for fun***

 - **Transform Yourself Year-Round** - why wait until the next Grand Gala to turn yourself into a snowman, flower, starfish, or ghost? Creates buttons that transform you for 15 GP (5 GP to turn back), including a never-before-seen Random Transformation item that randomly turns you into one of the four options. https://habitica.fandom.com/wiki/Transform_Yourself_Year-Round
